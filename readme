Docgen is a framework for creating sales invoices and filling in customs forms when shipping products.

Specification of PDF documents is performed using XML. PDFs can be created from scratch (custom) or existing
 PDF files can be written upon (overlay) when filling in customs forms.

A web application allows users to specify customers and the products being dispatched, and edit specified
fields, which are used when generating the pdf documents.

Generated PDFs are written to disk and opened on a new browser tab for review and printing.
